Lowering the gaze fashions a heart that is devoted to and focused on Allah.

A moment of dhikr is more powerful than a thousand moments of distraction. You were created for Jannah, not for this world.

Modesty is not weakness. It is light and dignity. Even a whisper of du'a is heard by the Most Merciful. No sin is greater than Allah’s mercy. Replace your music with Qur'an — and feel your soul breathe again.

[[[
When temptation calls, remember who you’re trying to please. You’ll never regret lowering your gaze — but you may regret not doing it.
Jannah is worth the struggle. Keep going. Allah does not burden a soul beyond that it can bear.

[[[
True strength is turning away from sin when no one is watching.

Your soul is a garden, and Allah's words are the water that nourishes it. Don't let the weeds of temptation choke out the beauty of your faith. Keep your heart hydrated with the Quran, and your spirit will flourish like a fragrant rose.

Remember, every step away from temptation is a step closer to Allah's mercy and love. Keep walking, dear one, and know that Jannah awaits you.

Ibn al-Qayyim رحمه الله said: 'Lowering the gaze fashions a heart that is devoted to and focused on Allāh. Letting the gaze wander distracts the heart and keeps it far from Allāh. There is nothing more harmful to a person than letting his gaze wander, as it creates alienation between a person and His Lord.' [One Hundred Pieces of Advice | Pg. 27]

Either feel the pain of discipline or feel the pain of regret

But the pain of regret is immeasurable.

Ibn Al-Qayyim رحمه الله said: 'To restrain oneself from fulfilling unlawful desires is easier than to endure that which is the result of doing so, because giving in to one's desires will either cause pain and punishment or it will prevent a more perfect pleasure than could ever be experienced in this worldly life.' [al-Fawaa'id | P.235]

'Ibn al-Qayyim رحمه الله said: 'Disobeying the desires puts a servant in a position that if he makes an oath by Allāh in supplication (to receive anything) Allāh will fulfil it. So He executes for him many folds more than the desires that he abandoned.' {روضة المحبين ١/٤٨٤} ABANDON YOUR DESIRE TO SIN SO THAT ALLAH WILL GRANT WHAT YOU MAKE DUA FOR

Sister Just breathe deeply. Don't panic—just allow those thoughts to pass. These thoughts come and go... So, there's no need to feel frustrated or panicky. Those emotions often drive relapses. Relax, urges come to everyone, but they go if you stick it out. Breathe and allow them to pass.
]]]
[[[
Sister think about the future.
You are doing this for Allah swt. You are doing this for yourself. You are doing this for your future family. You are doing this for a happy married life. You are doing this to get out of the mental health issues that PMO gave you. You are doing this to get your dopamine levels back to normalcy. You are doing this to get closer to the deen.
You are trying to be a better person. You are leaving this for a better life in this world and the hereafter.
So sister think of all the times you have PMO’d and felt disgusted. Felt absolutely terrible. You’ve given into the urge just for 10 seconds of pleasure followed by hours of regret and guilt feeling.
Don’t act on this urge sister.
Throw your phone, laptop, aside.
Get up and Go out for a walk.
I’ve always thought walking on grass barefoot was a lame suggestion. But recently I just sat on the grass and felt peaceful.
Go to the gym.
Just don’t sit idle. ACT against the urge.

Sister, just think about this. Every sin slowly leads one to kufr.

Imagine staying in Jahannam forever.

Surah Muminun 108: He (Allah) will say: 'Remain you in it with ignominy! And speak you not to Me!'

Do you really want to hear Allah saying this to you? Is it worth to walk in the path which leads to this?
]]]
[[[
You are stronger than your urges. You are YOU. Your urge is something else completely separate from you. Just because you feel it does not mean you have to act on it. Because you ARE that strong. Your urge can go on and do its own thing, You stay right there and hold firm.

Make the effort.

The eyes is the mirror of the heart…
 al-Imām Ibn al-Qayyim رحمه الله said: 'العين مرآة القلب، فإذا غض العبد بصره غض القلب شهوته وإرادته، وإذا أطلق بصره أطلق القلب شهوته.' 

 'The eye is the mirror of the heart, so if the slave lowers his gaze, the heart will lower its desires and whims, and if he lets his gaze wander, the desire in his heart will be released.' [رَوضةُ المُحبينَ صَـ | 109]

Allah sees everything Sister

Don't destroy your day/life for some minutes of "pleasure".

Get up, walk, do something, anything, run like Yusuf AS!!!

You have to choose between the pain of discipline and the pain of relapsing. Not having pain is impossible.

It's your decision.

The thing is Sister, you won’t find anything that brings you peace. You can look far and wide. Every site, open every tab.
You’ll only find peace when you search for Allah. Verily with the remembrance of Allah do hearts find peace.

Sister,

Take these words very seriously. Repeat this to yourself right now: I'm being brainwashed, I'm being brainwashed, I'm being brainwashed.

This is not who I am and I'm not going to let something else control me.

[[[
The thing is sister, your dopamine receptors can’t really make you do anything unless you allow them to in a sense. It’s really just an idea.

So say no.

Yes, I know it's difficult for you. But you must remember that Allah does not burden a soul beyond that it can bear.

Don't let yourself be drained by sin and pure evil. You can resist it sis, you can still fight.

Oppose your desires sister 🤍! Ibn al-Qayyim (رحمه الله) said, 'Medicine for the heart is to oppose whims and desires and that is the most difficult matter upon the soul and there is nothing more beneficial for it than this.' [Ighātha al-Lahafān, 1/69]

Leave this filthy sin for an increase in imaan my dear sister🤍. Allaah will aid you if you leave it off for his sake.

Don't give up Sister! Remember that Allah is watching you and the angels are recording every action you make so do not fall for the plot of Iblis!

bn al-Qayyim رحمه الله said: 'Abandoning desires for the sake of Allāh will rescue the servant from the punishment of Allāh and will guarantee one to obtain His mercy. The precious qualities of Allāh, the treasure of piety, pleasure, longing for Him, joy and the happiness found in being close to Him will never happen to the heart that cares for anyone or anything besides Allāh - even if he was among the people of worship, piety, and knowledge.' [al-Fawā'id]

Sister,

I know your real self is in there somewhere, and I know you don't want to do this. I know what you're feeling seems strong. But the fact is that this urge is actually very small and weak, and it's trying to trick you into thinking that this is a big deal and you need to act on it now!

You know in children's TV shows how a tiny harmless object can create a large scary shadow? But the lesson learned is that what we fear isn't always that scary when we confront it. That is what is happening right now!!! That tiny weak urge is trying to brainwash you into giving into your fears, falling, and ruining everything.

RUN NOW BEFORE IT IS TOO LATE!!!

Ibn al-Qayyim رحمه الله: 
 'Stand firm against evil thoughts, for if you fail to do so, they will become ideas, if you do not, they will become desires, so fight against them. If you do not, they will become a form of determination and intention, if you do not resist, they will become actions, and if you do not follow them up with their opposite, they will become habits that will be hard to quit.' 
 [Al-Fawaa’id | Pg. 54]

Dear believer,

Remember that your body is a trust from Allah, and your soul is precious. Your worth is not defined by these desires.

Seek refuge in Allah from the whispers of Shaytan, and find comfort in the Quran and prayer.

You are stronger than your temptations, and your faith can overcome any struggle.

Keep your gaze pure, your heart clean, and your soul nourished with the remembrance of Allah.

Repent, seek forgiveness, Allah's mercy is boundless, and His love for you is infinite.

Prove that
you prefer Allah's pleasure over your own pleasure,
you prefer the women of jannah over the women of this world,
you prefer pain in obeying Allah over the pleasure of disobeying him

Think of the sweetness of faith that comes with overcoming hardships. Don’t let short-term temptations lead to long-term regrets. Choose what is better, not what is easier. Strive for a life where your spirit is content and your heart is at peace. “As for those who struggle in Our cause, We will surely guide them along Our Way. And Allah is certainly with the good-doers.” (Quran 29:69)

Breathe and understand what is happening. Your addiction is being removed from you and it doesn't want to go. It's halfway out. And it wants to settle itself back inside you by shouting at you to entice you and seduce you.

You made it this far.

Don't ruin it all now.

The few years we have on this earth is nothing in comparison to eternity in the garden and we've only been granted one chance to pass this. 

We need to repent from sin before we lose this chance.

Let's not wake up on the final day wailing 'if only Allah guided me!'

[[[
The surveillance of Allah is eternal, while the dirty pleasure is mere seconds that leaves you with guilt and sins. 

Do you want Allah to see you had this chance to repent and you threw it away?

That urge you get when there’s an opportunity in front of you to sin. Ibn Taymiyyah رحمه الله describes it as an overpowering, burning desire, but that wudhu extinguishes it. Put this into practice. Next time you feel like sinning, go rush to make wudhu. It’ll stop you بإذن الله
