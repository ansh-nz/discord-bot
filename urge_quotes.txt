Lowering the gaze fashions a heart that is devoted to and focused on Allah. 
Your soul is a garden. Keep it nourished with the Qur'an. Every step away from temptation is a step toward Jannah. Stay strong — even the smallest act of obedience is beloved to Allah. Allah does not burden a soul beyond that it can bear. (Qur'an 2:286)
A moment of dhikr is more powerful than a thousand moments of distraction. You were created for Jannah, not for this world.
Modesty is not weakness. It is light and dignity. Even a whisper of du'a is heard by the Most Merciful. No sin is greater than Allah’s mercy. Replace your music with Qur'an — and feel your soul breathe again.
When temptation calls, remember who you’re trying to please. You’ll never regret lowering your gaze — but you may regret not doing it.
Jannah is worth the struggle. Keep going. Allah does not burden a soul beyond that it can bear. (Qur'an 2:286) (34)
True strength is turning away from sin when no one is watching. (43)
